      In this project, we utilize the power of React for building dynamic user
      interfaces and Tailwind CSS for efficient styling. The main functionality
      involves changing the background color of the page dynamically upon
      clicking different buttons. React's component-based architecture allows us
      to create reusable and maintainable UI components, while Tailwind CSS
      streamlines the styling process with its utility-first approach, enabling
      rapid prototyping and easy customization. By combining these technologies,
      we achieve a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user experience,
      with seamless color transitions enhancing user interaction.
